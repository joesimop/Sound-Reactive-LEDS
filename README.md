# Sound-Reactive-LEDS
Simple animations reacting to the analog pin of an Arduino using Fast Fourier Transforms.

!!!Very much a patchwork of code !!!

This program was intially made to be in a car, but was never implemented
cause my dad didn't want the lights permanently in his car.
The animation files aren't mine, the header files were coded by a fellow 
LED enthusiasts, Mark Kriegsman and Mary Corey March. The reactivity is all mine, 
and the FFT implementationwas changed from my implementation a library, as the library's
was much faster. This code is very much patch work of already written code.
